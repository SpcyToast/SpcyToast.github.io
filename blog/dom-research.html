      <h3>DOM NOTES</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM represents the document similar to how files are organised as a branching network with parent and children elements. Using the DOM allows developers to read, access, and update the contents of the document. This is useful as when using Javascript you can use the DOM to refer to specific parts of the html using classes and ID's defined in the CSS to then modify however you like. <a href="https://www.kirupa.com/html5/javascript_the_browser_and_the_dom.htm">resource</a>
