      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own
        emotions as well as others. Being emotionally intelligent means you are
        self aware and empathetic towards your peers. Being emotionally
        intelligent can allow for more effecitve communication and less stress
        or confilt to arise. Having emotional intelligence will allow for more
        pleasant interactions with other people and better productivity through
        more effecitve teamwork to occur.
      </p>
      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        EQ is not the same as IQ and one deals with logic and mental agility
        while the other focus on perceptions and empathy. You can high IQ
        without having high EQ and you can have high EQ without having high IQ.
        Having high IQ makes it seem like there a set of rules you need to
        follow that aligns with logic and reasoning in order to come up with an
        appropriate solution. While having high EQ might suggest that you take
        extra action to alleviate the stress of a situaiton or take caution
        while talking to someone who might be in a bad situaiton. There are many
        ways to show EQ, like lending a hand when it looks like someone is
        struggling or using language that conveys constructive critisim without
        being offensive. In a nuttshell, IQ involves feats of knowlegde, pattern
        recongition, and problem solving while EQ involves socials skills,
        empathy, and emotional awareness.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is important as conflict and friction within the
        indusrty causes a lack of motivation and teamwork. When people bad mouth
        and put each other down without understanding the whole piture, it can
        lead to bias against different teams and a lack of co-operation. Having
        good emotional intelligence makes you more appoachable and trustworthy
        as people value your input. Being able to understand someones situaiton
        can help you provide them with better adivice rather than dismissing
        their problems as irrelevent or inconsequential.
