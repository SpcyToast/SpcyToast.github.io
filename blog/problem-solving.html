      <h3>Simple Problem</h3>
      <p>
        My very simple problem involved misreading the instructions of what
        needed to be done for the task. This was made evident by having tests
        fail when trying to run it through the terminal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem was jumping the gun and going deeper in the object path
        before the rest of the path exsited. It's like having a recipe with a
        list of ingredients, except the instructions mentions extra ingredients
        you didn't know were just smaller pieces of the ingredients already
        listed.
      </p>
      <h3>Solving Problem</h3>
      <p>
        So to solve the problem, I did a console.log on both the object that
        wasn't working. From there I took a second look at what was expected to
        be done for the step as realised that I was supposed to make on
        extension to the object at a time. Difference in code shown below (left
        = old, right = new)
      </p>

        <img src="../images/object-1.png" alt="Code Snippet 2" width="250px" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Running this new fixed code worked and I gained a better understanding
        of how objects work. To put it simpily it's like finding out where
        someone might live, you can start by country, then break it down to
        state, then city, then suburb, and finally their address. However, it
        makes it very ambiguous if you're missing one of these. For example, if
        you're missing the city then you might have 5 different locations with
        the same street name. From my understanding, objects are very similar,
        where things need to exist before you can do more with them and you
        can't go down a path if the path isn't fully there.
      </p>
      <div class="figure-x">

      </div>
      <p>
        Above is reworked code that works the same but is more concise, this is
        insightful because if gives the impression that although a solution may
        work, there may be better solutions that you can find if you spend more
        time on it.

      <h3>Reluctance to Ask for Help</h3>
      <p>
        While working on the methods kata, I found myself stuck on trying to
        find a way to check array while being case insensitive. I found multiple
        solutions but my problem was that I couldn't get it to work. Instead of
        asking for help, I decided to try different methods of solving the
        problem. I found myself Reluctant to reach out as I had plenty of time
        to work on it and I enjoyed the challenge of figuring it out on my own.
        Next time I might try to reach out to someone else in the cohort to
        compare solutions, while my method worked I am stil curious to see if my
        original idea was worth pursuing.
