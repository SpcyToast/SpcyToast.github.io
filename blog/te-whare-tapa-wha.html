      <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        I personally have a horrible sleep schedule so I think my main goal for
        physical Wellbeing would be to try to maintian a regualar sleep
        schedule. Other than that I would love to try get in a consistent
        workout routine at home if not the gym. I would probably start slow and
        work up with mroe exercises and reps the more comfortable I get.
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        I am lucky to be surrounded by good natured people who can commuicate
        their feelings which has made it easier to keep up a good mental
        Wellbeing. A goal for me to improve my mental wellbeing could be to
        clean up more often, my room tends to get messy very quickly and I could
        be cleaning some of the more tedious items more often so making this
        change should have a very positive effect on me.
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        While I am far from religious, I hope that I can engage more in
        philosophy and build a better understanding on what life is and the
        value of the things around me. My goal would be to compliment the people
        around me more and help them recognise the value the have in my life
        rather than keeping all my opinions in my thoughts assuming they already
        know how amazing they are.
      </p>
      <h3>Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        In this sense I have many I would consider family by either blood or
        bond. My goal to enhance this connection would be to check in more
        often. Maybe try make different plans with each of them so I can spend
        time catching up and making new memories. I would also like to continue
        making connections with the people I meet and make a lasting found
        family through each of them.
      </p>
      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
      <p>
        As a foundation of this house I have decide to do something that might
        respark my wonder and curiosity by going star gazing once a week.
        Looking out into the vast emptiness of space might put things back into
        perspective and give me a chance to reflect on what I am doing and what
        can do in the future.
