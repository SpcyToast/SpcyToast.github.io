        Hello fellow humans, I'm Prashniel and I live in Auckland. Feel free to
        call me Prash or Toast

        I'd say honesty would be the value I think about most. I think that if
        you allow yourself to be dishonest even with smaller issues you're more
        likely to allow yourself to be dishonest in the future. Putting honesty
        into practice can allow for more constructive criticism to take place
        and allow people to better understand each other.

        I joined up with Dev Academy to merge my figurative git branch back with
        my original goal of becoming a software engineer and work in tech. I
        studied civil engineering at the University of Auckland as that's what I
        got placed into after first year and eventually got a job as a graduate
        site engineer. It only took a few months of work for me to realise this
        is not what I want and I should try get back into tech as soon as
        possible. Eventually I after talking to people in the industry and some
        old professors, I landed here at Dev Academy ready take back my future
        and evolve into a certified code monkey.
