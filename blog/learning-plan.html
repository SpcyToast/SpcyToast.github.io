      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        My long term career goal is to be working in tech, unsure currently in
        what feild. I know I want this because I've always enjoyed coding since
        I was in highschool and I even worked on a VR game for my final year
        project at university. My original plan was to do software engineeering
        but I got allocated in civil engineeering so i just went with it. I am
        using Dev Academy as a way to get back on track of my original career
        aspiration and get into tech.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        My strength is that I can hyperfocus on a task when I need to, I am very
        good at finding conections and understanding the content while
        hyperfocus. However, I also tend to procrastinate a lot when I feel like
        I have a lot of time to do a task. I find it very hard to get through
        things in the beginning of the week and very easy closer towards the
        end. I also like to test my understanding by helping people solve
        problems, always keeping an eye on the tech-questions channel on
        discord.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I hope to develop my teamwork skills while working on projects in
        person. I find myself a lot more engaged while working online and in my
        own space while a bit less confortable in person. I tend to be more
        quiet and find it very difficult to interject my opinion while in
        person. If I had to guess I'd say I am more nervous speaking when I know
        everyones attention is on me, online is easier as I can easily pretend I
        am talking in a void.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will try my best to keep myself busy throughout the weeks with the
        sprints by breaking down the sprints work into at least 5 managable
        chunks and aim to finish one chunk a day. During bootcamp I think I will
        be able to stay productive as I tend to work better with people around
        me, I feel less likely to procrastinate when there are other people also
        being productive around me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </h4>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If things start to get to me I will most likely step away and do a short
        task and come back to reassess the problem. I find doing this gives me a
        chance too cool off and remember what has been done and what hasn't been
        doing on the project. If it's a small error I might be able to catch the
        mistake too with a fresh pair of eyes. If this doesn't work I will reach
        out to my peers or the facilitators to try and solve the problem.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I usually try to figure out the problem myself by either looking through
        the material provided for hints or using google. If I am worried about
        time, I will reach other to others and try to work on other stuff while
        waiting for a responce to a question. If I absolutely have no time to
        look for or get help I will accept is as a lost cause and try learn from
        any mistakes made after an assessment is made on the work attempted.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect them to provide hints that will lead me to a solution rather
        than give me a straight answers. If it's a technical issue I hope they
        will work with me and try guide me to a solution. Otherwise I hope the
        facilitators try and ecourage collaboration amongst peers by encouraging
        them to help each other solve each others problems.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am very flexible, I find myself more likely to work at night and past
        midnight as it's usually more quiet. I also try to work on things when I
        have downtime as it's easier to break things up and test my knowledge to
        see if I remember things.
