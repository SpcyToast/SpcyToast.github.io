      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brains abilty to make and reorganise connections
        in it own neural network, in a sense, the brain is rewiring itself in
        response to new experiences. There are 2 major mechanisms involved with
        neuroplasticity and they include structural plasticity and functional
        reorganization. structural plasticity involves the brains physical
        structure changing due to experiences or memories while functional
        plasticity involves brain functions moving from an damaged area to an
        undamaged on to help with recovery. Understanding and utilising
        neuroplasticity is benifical as it helps you learn new things and boost
        your memory. Some things you can do to improve your neuroplasticity
        include learning a new language, imparing one of your senses, or
        exercising. Through constant practice your mind will become more
        malleable and take in more from your environment to strengthen those
        neurons.

        By understanding these principles and being aware of how to make use of
        them they should help improve how fast you learn something and take in
        information. By working on a new skill and strengthening that connection
        in your brain you're allowing yourself to become familiar with what
        works and what doesn't as well as seeing similarities in different
        things that can help improve your understanding of them.
