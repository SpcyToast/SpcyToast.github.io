      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brains abilty to make and reorganise connections
        in it own neural network, in a sense, the brain is rewiring itself in
        response to new experiences. There are 2 major mechanisms involved with
        neuroplasticity and they include structural plasticity and functional
        reorganization. structural plasticity involves the brains physical
        structure changing due to experiences or memories while functional
        plasticity involves brain functions moving from an damaged area to an
        undamaged on to help with recovery. Understanding and utilising
        neuroplasticity is benifical as it helps you learn new things and boost
        your memory. Some things you can do to improve your neuroplasticity
        include learning a new language, imparing one of your senses, or
        exercising. Through constant practice your mind will become more
        malleable and take in more from your environment to strengthen those
        neurons.

          Growth Mindset
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is when you believe your skillset is not fixed and with
        effort you can obtain new skills. While working with a fixed mindset you
        are limiting your potential as you believe that with no matter how much
        effort you put into a task your abilites will not change. As I have been
        exposed to this concept before, nothing has changed for me, however, I
        will be trying to intergrate it more in my learning journey by trying to
        look deeper into subjects rather than being okay with a surface level
        examination, By doing this I hope to be more prepared for more complex
        issues and spend less time trying to figure things out through trial and
        error or research.

      <h3>Impact on Learning</h3>
      <p>
        By understanding these principles and being aware of how to make use of
        them they should help improve how fast you learn something and take in
        information. By working on a new skill and strengthening that connection
        in your brain you're allowing yourself to become familiar with what
        works and what doesn't as well as seeing similarities in different
        things that can help improve your understanding of them. Also having
        that mindset where you believe you can improve with something you're
        stuggling with should benefit your ability to solve problems rather than
        giving up once hitting a hurdle. Believing that something is impossible
        will ruin your motiviation to get it done while having a mindset where
        you can achieve anything you put your mind to will help you come up with
        different solutions and look into the problem deeper.
