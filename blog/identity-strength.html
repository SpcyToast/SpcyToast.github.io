      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>

        I own and manage a discord server for all the friends and people I meet
        online. I like to keep this server open to all and advocate free speech
        so people feel comfortable and welcome. At one point a 13 yr old kid
        join the server and was joining on conversations by listening in the
        background. This cause concern amongst the other users of my server as
        they did not feel comfortable speaking freely with kids around. I decide
        to remove the kid from the server and add a rule in stating you had to
        be 18+ to join. After repeated occurances of him trying to rejoin, I
        decided to outright ban him. While trying to be inclusive I did my best
        to make my server accessable to all but if I had to do hard moderation
        on all the content people post to ensure my server was child friendly
        then it would have made the server a lot less comfortable to be in.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I personally am more removed from my ethincal culture as I am agnostic
        and do not practice anything realted to indian tradition. I have instead
        embraced internet culture specifically the gaming and streaming side of
        things. It has influenced my values by making me aware of peoples
        perspectives of relationships and how strangers treat strangers. It has
        also given me more respect for people privacy as online personalities
        have lost careers over cancel culture because a private matter had
        become public. It has made me realise that being up front and honest
        with who you are will help build the best and longest lasting
        relationships as well as give you a reputation for integrity.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        My biggest strength is that I am calm and collected even in stressful
        situaitons. I think this will support me by allowing me to look through
        code for errors without getting frustrated at the small things. I Am
        also very good at computers according to my peers as they come to me for
        a lot of problems and I think this will help by allowing me to quickly
        solve any tech related issues I'll encounter for me and my peers.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My biggest weakness is that I get easily distracted and am a bit quiet
        in group settings. I think this will affect my journey by causing me to
        a bit slower while doing tasks and just finding it a little more
        difficult to get my input in for group meetings. I hope Dev Academy will
        provide me with the experinece to overcome this.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        When working on a large project in university, there were moments of
        disagreements when decide to things one way or another. So we decide to
        break up into smaller groups and have leaders for each group. The group
        members would agree on things internally and the leaders would keep each
        other informed of each other groups activites. This worked well until
        the end where everyone submitted the work and had issues with the
        formatting team designing things one way instead of another. So everyone
        voted on a design style at the end and that is what we stuck to. I would
        like to try collaborative competive teamwark in the future. Where
        everyone has their task and they competing to produce the best work they
        can while also helping each other out. In the end there is a vote on who
        did the best and who helped the most and the group decides on a reward
        unanimously before starting.
