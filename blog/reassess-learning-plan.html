      <h3>Myself</h3>
      <p>
        I have learnt many things about my self and my ego during my time
        working in foundations. I have learnt that I find it impossible to
        function in high heat and if I'm finding it difficult to proceed the
        best thing for me to do to stay productive is to take a break or work on
        something else. I have also learnt that I am very confident when it
        comes to finding solutions on my own, I very good at breaking problems
        down and going step by step using trial and error.
      </p>
      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        I think it's very important to understand people when you're working on
        computers. You need to understand that people have different
        perspectives and experiences that may change the way they use the things
        you make. Having a better understand of yourself and others will only
        help you make better decisions and work eassier with people. Having
        people enjoy working with you is never a bad thing, being fun to be
        around increases everyones motivation and will help set you up to
        succeed.
      </p>
      <h3>Core learning</h3>
      <p>
        The most challenging part about core learning for me is also what I
        found to be the most surprising. I personally grew up thinking things
        like having a growth mindset and good te whare tapa wha princples as
        something everyone already does. Even when I found out about
        neruoplasticity, I thought that this idea was normal and people already
        live knowing this. To my surprise this wasn't the case and come to terms
        with that was very challenging.

      <h3>Programming School Teaching Core</h3>
      <p>
        I think as a school whos goal is to get their career ready as soon as
        possible, teaching core is important because it makes you easier to work
        with. Being stubborn and unwilling to grow as a person will make you
        less likely to preform above and beyond while working. Accepting that
        you can be better and that anything is possible if you work hard enough
        for it will only help you grow as a person and should also reflect in
        your personality. The difference is instead of saying "this won't work
        we can't do it" you say "Alright lets give it a go and maybe we get
        there, maybe we don't".
      </p>
      <h3>Learning Core</h3>
      <p>
        I think my time learning core was justified. I found coding fun and easy
        but delving deeper into core I found a lot more resistance and needed
        more time to think about the concepts. If this was unimportant and easy
        to grasp, it would have taken me much less time and I would've been done
        with it all with a snap of my fingers. But by asking questions and going
        deeper into these concepts it has given me time to reflect and
        understand why I should have one mindset instead of another and how to
        chenge my behaviour in order to improve my experiences with coding and
        people. Because at the end of the day, I'll be interacting with people
        not just code.
