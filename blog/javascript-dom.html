      <h3>Javascript in relation to HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine you're putting on a show like a play in a theater. You have all you actors, props, staging, and equipment set and ready to go. The shows going on and the people backstage are scrambling to get everything ready in time for people to come on stage and put on a good preformance. The time comes and all of a sudden there is no lighting or sound or other technical elements. This is pretty much what a webpage is like without Javascript. The preformance you see is like the HTML page where as CSS is all the prepwork happening backstage to make sure all the visuals look good. While JavaScript is element that really makes the preformance pop by adding dynamic features that change in real time depending on the situaiton. When the script is going it will make necessary changes to keep the viewer engaged with the show while not taking away from the information being given.

      <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is like going up to a bouncer at a club and getting your ID checked, you aren't getting in if you aren't old enough. Think of it like a locked door where the key is the condition that needs. It could be checking whether or not something is true or false or if the value of something is in the expected range. You can use flow control to make your website do things that it's expected similar to how you expect people to behave in real life. For example, if it's raining you grab an umbrella, if you are hungry you get some food, if you are tired you get some sleep, if there is something spooky you get spooked <div class="figure-x">

        Where as loops are very similar to working out. When you do some reps of an exercise, you are looping the same movements until you reached your goal. When you a set of exercises it is like doing a loop of loops. To pt it simply, you pick a starting point, set a condition (i.e. keep going until you've done 20 reps), and then go through with the exercise one increment at a time. There are 2 reasons why you would want to use a loop, the first to to saying you doing something a certain ammount of times rather than saying you doing something every single time you do it. The second is when you want to use the increment values to output unique sets of information based on the current increment of the loop.<div class="figure-x">

      <h3>DOM Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Do you remember back in school when you were asked to draw up a family tree to show who decended from who and who is responsible for your existence? Well the DOM is very similar to that except it uses elements from the HTML and CSS. Instead of ancestory, the DOM breaks down the larger elements into smaller elements so you can reference them when coding with JavaScript. Using the DOM and JavaScript, you can gather information on the HTML and CSS element of your website and use it to modify the elements within or even make it so the elements in your website react to data in real time. For example, you might have a calculator app where you can imput 2 numbers that add togther. Using JavaScript you can reference the inputs from DOM and do the calculations, then output the calculations back into the website with another DOM reference.
        
        The DOM represents the document similar to how files are organised as a branching network with parent and children elements. Using the DOM allows developers to read, access, and update the contents of the document. This is useful as when using Javascript you can use the DOM to refer to specific parts of the html using classes and ID's defined in the CSS to then modify however you like. <a href="https://www.kirupa.com/html5/javascript_the_browser_and_the_dom.htm">resource</a>

      <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
      <p>
        Accessing data from arrays is very different from accessing it from objects. Think of arrays like a menu where the food items are in a numbered list. When you want a specific item, you can refer to the number instead of saying the name of the item which is very handy when you don't think you can pronounce the name of what you're ordering. Objects on the other hand is like ordering a tea or coffee. First you pick either tea or coffee, then if you want it hot or cold, with or without milk, small medium or large.... so on and so forth. Basically, an object is a list of items where the items can have their own set of values that are variable.

      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are like contractors, you call them when you have a problem and they will come in to solve it. They each have their own unique set of skills that they use to finish the job, and they will only come when you call them. Make sure to call the right contractor for the job because if you call a plumber to come and fix your car then don't expect anything to happen. In some instances a contractor might even call another contractor for help, like a builder calling an electrician so they can get their frames just right. Functions are basically blocks of code where if you need it you can call it. For example, when a user pushes a button on your website, a function is probably called to make the button do what it's expected to do. <div class="figure-x">
