      Q: What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
    </h1>
    <h2>Best practices for using classes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use classes for multiple elements and make them reusable throughout your
        html
      </li>
      <li>
        Use classes for styling, use the !important tag when you want one class
        to take priority over another
      </li>
      <li>Order you classes in order of priority in the css file</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Best practices for using ID</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use ID for styling a single element</li>
      <li>Avoid using IDs for styling purposes</li>
      <li>
        Avoid using IDs unless you want to improve load speed and compatability
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overlap between ids and classes</h2>
    <p>
      DO's:<br />
      When naming classes and IDs, keep names concise and descriptive of it's
      functionality. Use a css to declare classes and IDs and use multiple style
      sheets if the html design is large and complex. using a css file will help
      improve the preformance and readability of the html.When using the
      creating classes and IDs that are important but don't need the important
      tag, add a comment to explain why the class or ID should not be overriden.
    </p>
    <p>
      DON'T's:<br />
      Avoid using generic or irrelevent names and it makes the readability a lot
      more difficult. Ensure these names also are either using cammelcase or
      lowercase with hyphens, do not mix and match to avoid confusion.Try keep
      all styling elements on a css sheet rather than inline of the html as it
      makes it easier to access and maintain as well as improve preformance.
      Avoid using !important where possible as it may override a more important
      class.
